Today I received a nice email from [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com), to start the New Year with momentum: the email refers to [this data breach](https://restoreprivacy.com/music-service-deezer-data-breach/).

I took this as an opportunity to make some kind reminders to myself ðŸ‘‡

### Don't use the same email everywhere
Instead of using the same email everywhere, use a *catch-all email* or a handy service to have random emails forwarded to your real email address: I'm thinking of Apple's [Hide My Email](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425) or [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com), for example. This way you can disable the disposable mailname at any time (or you can notice some breaches before they are published): I mean, if you use the `sumo_01welfare@icloud.com` address just for Spotify and start getting spam and advertisements on that address you will know immediately who lost/sold your data.

### Use a proxy or a VPN you can trust
My advice is to use iCloud Private Relay or a very reliable VPN (I use [AirVPN](https://airvpn.org) when I need it). Don't use - please don't! - any of the overly commercial VPNs that infest youtube with advertisements ðŸ‘€. IP address (even if under a NAT) can be used in many ways, so try to avoid revealing it to others.

### Do not reveal your name or your real date of birth...
...Unless it is strictly necessary to be recognizable: this way, you will reduce the capacity for impersonation by evil actors.

### Do not reveal your gender...
...Unless it is strictly necessary for the service you're about to subscribe to.

### Use all your devices and all interfaces in English
Even knowing what your primary language is is an information that can come in handy for bad actors.

### For payments, try to use ApplePay or GooglePay whenever possible
If breach history has a value (and it does), with Apple and Google handling your payments you can be reasonably comfortable.
